### Hi there 👋
My name is **Michał** and currently I'm working as a `Software Engineer` in [Just Join IT](https://justjoin.it/).
My area of expertise is primarily **JavaScript development** on both backend 🛠️ and frontend 🖼️, but I also like to try new things in my private projects such as:
- Ruby/Rails
- .NET
- Python
- Lua

I'm also learning a bit of cloud ☁️ development right now.<br>
Here's my [Google Cloud Skills Boost profile](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/7f2feff8-a775-46db-955b-2c313c827e46).
Via this platform I've completed the following courses:
- Serverless Firebase Development (Application Modernization)
- Build a Website on Google Cloud (Infrastructure Modernization)
- Serverless Cloud Run Development (Application Modernization)


Some of my personal projects are listed in tiles below so feel free to check them out ✨.
