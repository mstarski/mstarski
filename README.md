### Hi there 👋
My name is **Michał** and currently I'm working as a `Software Engineer` in [Just Join IT](https://justjoin.it/).
My area of expertise is primarily **JavaScript development** on both backend 🛠️ and frontend 🖼️, but I also like to try new things in my private projects such as:
- Ruby/Rails
- .NET
- Python
- Lua

I'm also learning a bit of cloud ☁️ development right now.

Few of my personal projects are listed in tiles below so feel free to check them out ✨.
